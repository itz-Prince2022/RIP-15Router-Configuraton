# 🖧 Multi-Router Network Design using RIP (15 Routers)

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a **15-router network topology** using **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** to enable dynamic routing and end-to-end connectivity across multiple networks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Designed a scalable network consisting of **15 routers**
- Implemented **RIP version 2** for dynamic routing
- Configured proper **IP addressing and subnetting**
- Verified network connectivity and routing convergence
- Performed troubleshooting to resolve routing and connectivity issues

This project helped me understand **dynamic routing fundamentals**, routing tables, hop count metrics, and real-world network troubleshooting.
